      Summary
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I work as a shift manager at a thermal power station. A year ago 
      I was in love with what I do. But now I feel myself like Homer 
      Simpson at the control panel. I got into the comfort zone, I got bored.
      I know for sure what to do in  case of any accident at the 
      station and how to prevent it.  It scares me so much that I can 
      meet my retirement on the boiler house. So that why I’m looking 
      for interesting projects, courses, new knowledges, a new
      experience. In truth, I'm just starting to learn programming.
      Therefore, I can not boast of the literature, which I have already
      read. I also have not completed projects. But the last time such a 
      feeling of delight and inspiration came to me when I was learning
      to play the guitar. I did not let the instrument out of my hands. 
      And today I spent almost all my free time studying the new information,
      watched the video, read the articles in order to 
      better understand new material about git.

    <p> Like many people, I learned English at school. Last year improved
        the level with a tutor. I had to communicate with the Italians in 
        English about the issues of delivery  of equipment, the necessary 
        technical documentation. I try to improve my English by watching 
        films in a foreign language, sometimes I visit speaking clubs, I 
        actively use various Internet applications such as <https://lingualeo.com/ru> 
        Travelling is my passion.  Communication and 
        problem solving  does not cause difficulties during the trip
        thanks to the knowledge of English.</p>
