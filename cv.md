## Summary

I work as a *shift manager at a thermal power station*. A year ago I was in love with what I do. But now I feel myself like Homer Simpson at the control panel. I got into the comfort zone, I got bored. I know for sure what to do in  case of any accident at the station and how to prevent it.  It scares me so much that I can meet my retirement on the boiler house. So that why Iâ€™m looking for interesting projects, courses, new knowledges, a new experience. In truth, I'm just starting to learn programming. Therefore, I can not boast of the literature, which I have already read. I also have not completed projects. But the last time such a feeling of delight and inspiration came to me when I was learning to play the guitar. I did not let the instrument out of my hands. And today I spent almost all my free time studying the new information, watched the video, read the articles in order to better understand new material about git.

I am

- fast learning
- resourceful
- independent
- reliable
- hard-working.
